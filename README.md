# üõ£Ô∏è US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## üîç Problem Statement:
- Analyze a dataset of 3.6 million US accident records from 2016 to mid-2020 to identify patterns, trends, and correlations. The project aims to provide insights into factors influencing road accidents such as weather conditions, time of day, and road features, as well as explore accident severity and duration.

## üéØ Objective:
- To clean and analyze the US accidents dataset using Python and its libraries, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and derive actionable insights to help improve road safety. The project also demonstrates handling large datasets efficiently.

## üìä Key Insights:
- Time of Accidents: Accidents are most frequent during rush hours, particularly between 7-11 AM and 4-7 PM, likely due to increased traffic during commuting times.

- Day of the Week: There are fewer accidents on weekends compared to weekdays, suggesting that workday traffic contributes significantly to the overall accident count.

- Accident Trends Over Time: The number of accidents has generally increased over the years, except for 2020, which saw fewer accidents due to incomplete data (up to June).

- Geographical Distribution: Certain states (like California, Texas, and Florida) and cities have disproportionately high numbers of accidents. This may be related to population density, road conditions, and weather factors.

- Weather Conditions: A large proportion of accidents occur in clear and cloudy weather, but poor visibility and rain also contribute significantly. This highlights that even in non-extreme weather conditions, accidents are prevalent.

- Severity and Duration: Accidents with higher severity tend to last longer, indicating that more severe incidents may lead to prolonged road closures and disruptions.

- Road Features: Traffic signals are associated with the highest number of accidents, while roundabouts, bumps, and stop signs contribute minimally. This emphasizes the importance of traffic management in reducing accidents at critical junctions.

- Hotspot Identification: The analysis identified key accident hotspots using geographic coordinates, suggesting that certain areas are more prone to accidents, which could guide future infrastructure improvements. 

- Temperature and Accidents: A higher percentage of accidents occur in colder areas (below 60¬∞F), followed by regions with moderate temperatures (60¬∞F to 75¬∞F). Warmer regions account for fewer accidents, suggesting that colder climates with snow, ice, or fog may contribute to more hazardous driving conditions.

- Day vs. Night Distribution: A significantly larger number of accidents occur during the day than at night. This is likely due to increased traffic during daylight hours when more people are on the road for commuting, work, and errands. However, night driving, despite lower accident volume, may involve other risks like reduced visibility.

- Severity of Accidents (Day vs. Night): There is no major difference in accident severity between day and night. While fewer accidents happen at night, the distribution of severity levels is consistent across both time periods, suggesting that factors other than the time of day, such as road conditions or driver behavior, may impact accident severity.
